### Federal tax deposits

In IRS terminology, **semiweekly** means wages paid on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday are generally due the following Wednesday, and wages paid on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday are generally due the following Friday. In practice, that usually means depositing within 3 to 5 business days after payday. It does **not** mean biweekly payroll and it does **not** mean semi-monthly payroll.

For the current IRS deposit rules, see [IRS Topic no. 757, Forms 941 and 944 - deposit requirements](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc757).

- Contractors: Not subject to withholding
