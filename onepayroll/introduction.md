# Welcome to OnePayroll

OnePayroll is a comprehensive payroll management extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. It streamlines your entire payroll process, from employee setup through tax reporting, while keeping all your payroll data directly connected to your general ledger.

## Why choose OnePayroll?

## Key concepts

When you work with OnePayroll, you'll interact with these core concepts:

### Payroll Run
A payroll run is a processing batch that calculates and processes wages for a group of employees for a specific period. Payroll runs have a defined workflow with statuses: Draft → Calculated → Ready → Posted. You can preview results before posting to ensure accuracy.

### Pay Types
Pay types represent different components of employee compensation: earnings (base salary, overtime, bonuses) and deductions (taxes, insurance, garnishments). Each pay type belongs to a category that determines how it's calculated and displayed.

### Pay Cycles
Pay cycles define how often employees are paid and when payroll periods occur. Common schedules include weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly, and monthly. Each pay cycle specifies the number of periods per year and uses schedule lines with date formulas to define period start, period end, and payment dates.

### Employees
Employees in OnePayroll extend the standard Business Central employee record with payroll-specific information: pay group assignment, employee type, payment methods with bank details for direct deposit, and garnishment details.

### Benefits
Benefits are company-sponsored programs (health insurance, retirement plans, wellness programs) that employees can enroll in. OnePayroll tracks employee coverage, calculates employer liabilities, and integrates benefits deductions into payroll.

### Payment Methods
Employee Payment Methods define how employees receive their wages. Each record stores allocation rules (Primary, Fixed Amount, or Percentage) and bank details (Bank Account No., Bank Identifier Code). The payment type (Computer Check or Electronic Payment) is determined by the payment method assigned to the employee's payment batch.

### Tax Calculations
OnePayroll calculates federal, state, and local income tax withholding using a jurisdiction-based architecture. Each Income Tax Jurisdiction defines its own calculation method (Standard or Simplified), and employee withholding records are automatically maintained based on the employee's location.
