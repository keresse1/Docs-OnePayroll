# About payroll reports

OnePayroll includes reports for analyzing payroll data, reviewing payroll runs, and managing employee compensation. Reports are available from the **Payroll Manager** Role Center, from the **Payroll Runs** page, and through the Business Central search.

## Available reports

### Employee-facing reports

### Payroll analysis reports
