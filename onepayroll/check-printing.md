# Check printing and management

OnePayroll prints employee paychecks by delegating to the standard Business Central check printing process. When a payroll run is created, payment batches are automatically created for employees, grouped by payment method. Batches for employees with a check payment method are processed from the **Payroll Payments** page.

## Check payment workflow

1. Create, review, and (optionally) post a payroll run.
2. Open the **Payroll Payments** page.
3. Select the employee check payment batch for the payroll run.
4. Choose the **Pay** action. The batch's payment method determines the payment type (Computer Check).
5. Business Central's check printing process runs and prints the checks.
6. Distribute printed checks to employees.

## Prerequisites

### Employee payment methods

Each employee who should receive a check needs an Employee Payment Method record. Open the Employee Card and choose the **Payment Methods** action to manage the employee's payment methods.

On the Employee Payment Method card:

- **Name** — identifies this payment method
- **Priority** — determines the ordering when the employee has multiple payment methods
- **Allocation Type** — Primary, Fixed Amount, or Percentage
- **Allocation** — the allocation amount (for Fixed Amount or Percentage types)
- **Payment Method** — a reference to a standard BC Payment Method code

The **Communication** group on the card contains address fields (Address, City, Post Code, County, Country/Region Code) for the payee.

For check payments, bank account fields (Bank Account No. and Bank Identifier Code) are typically left blank. The check is printed to the name and address specified on the Employee Payment Method.

### Standard BC Payment Method

The **Payment Method** code assigned to the Employee Payment Method must have:

- **Default Bank Payment Type** = **Computer Check** — so that OnePayroll uses the check printing process for these payments.
- **Bal. Account No.** — set to the employer bank account that checks are drawn from. This bank account determines the check stock and numbering.

If you pay employees from more than one employer bank account, create a separate Payment Method code for each bank account (for example, `CHECK-MAIN` and `CHECK-BRANCH`). The check printing report prompts you to select the bank account.

### Pay group configuration

The pay group must have a **Gen. Journal Template** and **Gen. Journal Batch** configured. OnePayroll uses these internally during payment processing.

## Print checks

### Step 1: Post the payroll

1. Create a payroll run for the pay group.
2. Review payroll entries.
3. Approve (if required) and post the payroll.

### Step 2: Pay from Payroll Payments

1. Open the **Payroll Payments** page (from the role center cues or by searching for *Payroll Payments*).
2. Locate the employee check payment batch for the payroll run.
3. Choose the **Pay** action.

OnePayroll runs the Business Central check printing process. Checks print to the configured printer or generate PDF output.

### Step 3: Preview paychecks

To review paycheck details before or after printing:

1. On the **Payroll Runs** page, select the payroll run.
2. Select **Paycheck** to preview paycheck details for each employee.

### Step 4: Archive paychecks (optional)

To save PDF copies to employee dossiers:

1. On the **Payroll Runs** page, select the payroll run.
2. Select **Save in Dossier**.

## Troubleshooting

### No payment entries for Computer Check

- Verify employees have payment methods assigned (Employee Card → **Payment Methods** action).
- Ensure payment entries exist for the payroll run (check **Payment Entries** on the Payroll Runs page or **Show Payment Entries** on the Payroll Payments page).

### Printing alignment issues

- Verify paper size matches the report layout settings.
- Adjust printer settings for check alignment.
- Test with sample paper before production printing.
